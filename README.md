# ðŸ‘‹ Hello Shaders

This repo is a notebook for my Shader's course. 

If you're interested in how I've learned Shaders, you can check the folder `/exercises`, there are code and recap inside each lesson.

If you're curious about Shaders, you can read more about it at [The Book of Shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com/).
